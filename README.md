# Raypong - classic pong game written in c/raylib
Wow this naming is going out of control.
### Details
2 player pong game written in 40 minutes cus i was bored. Controls are "W/S" and "UP/DOWN".
### Compile & run
You can use "run.sh" script to compile and run the game on UNIX-like systems or just compile it yourself. Maybe I will make a release for Windows some day not sure rn its kinda quirky on macos xd
