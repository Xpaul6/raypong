# Raypong - classic pong game written in c/raylib
Wow this naming is going out of control.

## Details
Pong game initially written in 40 minutes cus i was bored. Two game modes: two players and versus ai. Controlls are
"W/S" for left racket and "UP/DOWN" fro right one. AI algorithm behaves weirdly but i didn't come up with anything better,
suggestions will be appreciated.

## Compile & run
Compile and run the game with `make run` command. **Warning**: compilation on windows is untested and unstable.

## ToDo
 - [x] Main GUI menu
 - [x] Versus AI mode
 - [ ] Deep refactoring
 - [x] Make ai more "humane" and actually beatable
